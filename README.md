# Express.js POST Request Body Validation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications related to handling POST requests with empty or invalid request bodies.  The bug involves a lack of robust validation, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes when processing requests without the expected data.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application that attempts to process a POST request to `/users`.  It expects a JSON payload with a `name` property. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the request body is empty or missing the `name` property. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the application.  It adds proper validation to check if the request body is present and contains the required `name` property. If validation fails, it returns a descriptive error message to the client.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install express`
4. Run `node bug.js`
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with an empty body or without a `name` property using a tool like Postman or curl.

## How to run the solution
1. Follow steps 1-3 from the previous section.
2. Run `node bugSolution.js`
3. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with a valid JSON body including a `name` property.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive request body validation in Express.js applications to prevent unexpected errors and ensure application stability.
